# Learn-and-Play-Architecture

Sample Project about the last module of the Learn & Play process.
Is a very simple example of the implementation of an agenda.

The partition in layers is essential but clean:
- Representation Layer with an extremely basic UI implementation (HTML + Javascript (and JQuery))
- Application Layer: Rest API project using .Net 6
- Data Access Layer: comunications with a simple database using Entity Framework 6
